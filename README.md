# Getting started with AVG Wireframes

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### To run the dev server:

    npm run dev
    yarn dev

## External libraries used for components

- clsx
- tailwind-clip-path

## What this project achieves

- Full NextJS application complete together with tailwindcss
- No usage of traditional css

## What it is lacking

- State management tool (though not required at present)
